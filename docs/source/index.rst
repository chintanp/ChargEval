WSDOT-EVSE documentation
==========================

WSDOT-EVSE is a decision support system for electric vehicle infrastructure (EVI)  design for the state of Washington, USA. The underlying modeling framework is general enough that the tool can be used at any scale, any where.

The decision to build EVI is a complex one and is dependent on several factors. WSDOT-EVSE uses combination of models to predict the EVSE utilization. The documents detail the various components of the WSDOT-EVSE system and the component models involed.
