Data Requirement
================

The data requirements of EVI-DSS can be classified into two categories, static and dynamic. 

.. (also cross-link these with the respective models, so each model should have a link to the dataset it uses. Maybe here mention all the models that this dataset is used in.) 

Static Datasets
===============

Zipcode Details
---------------
The details about the zipcodes needed include the lat-long of the centroid of the zipcode. For this purpose, the R package `zipcode`_ is used. 



Dynamic Datasets
