ChargEval documentation
==========================

ChargEval is a decision support system for electric vehicle infrastructure (EVI)  design for the state of Washington, USA. The underlying modeling framework is general enough that the tool can be used at any scale, any where.

.. note::
   The live demo of the EV Infrastructure Designer is `here`_ and some sample runs can be seen in the `Results Viewer here`_.

The decision to build EVI is a complex one and is dependent on several factors. ChargEval uses combination of models to predict the EVSE utilization. The documents detail the various components of the ChargEval system and the component models involed.
